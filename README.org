* Description
An API for interacting with the Trade Data found on [[https://uktradeinfo.com/][UKTradeInfo]], a website that
publishes UK Import/Export data to both EU/NonEU countries.

Adapted from previous work I did to build a Trade Data application back in 2016,
but figured an actual API to make requests from anything would be useful for
Govt in general.
